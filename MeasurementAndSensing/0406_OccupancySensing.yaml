        name: PIR Occupied To Unoccupied Delay
        description: The PIROccupiedToUnoccupiedDelay attribute is 16-bits in length
            and specifies the time delay, in seconds, before the PIR sensor changes
            to its occupied state when the sensed area becomes unoccupied. This attribute,
            along with PIRUnoccupiedToOccupiedTime, may be used to reduce sensor 'chatter'
            when used in an area where occupation changes frequently.
