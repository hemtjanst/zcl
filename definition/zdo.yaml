      is sent to the ZigBee coordinator from two different devices simultaneously.
      * If the supplied endpoint is outside the specified range - a reply is sent with status `InvalidEndpoint`
      * If only one device sends the request within a pre-configure timeout - a reply is sent with status `Timeout`
      * If the ProfileID doesn't match or none of the In/OutClusterList elements match - a reply is sent with status `NoMatch`
      * Otherwise, a reply is sent with status `Success` to each device

      The Coordinator then needs to either send `BindRequest` or `UnbindRequest` for each matched `ClusterID`.
      This is done by first issuing a `UnbindRequest` with any of the matched `ClusterID`:
      * If the reply status is `NoEntry` - `BindRequest` will instead be sent for each matched `ClusterID`
      * If the reply status is `Success` - additional unbind requests are sent the rest of the matched cluster

      This enables the request to toggle the binding.
