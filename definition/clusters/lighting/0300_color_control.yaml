          are used as an index in the implementation specific XY lookup table to
          provide the non-equidistance steps. The lower 8 bits are used to
          interpolate between these steps in a linear way in order to provide color
          zoom for the user. To provide compatibility with standard ZCL, the
          CurrentHue attribute contains a hue value in the range 0 to 254,
